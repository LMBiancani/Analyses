```{css, echo=FALSE}
/* Define a background class for displaying content of slurm submission text files */
.bg_slurm {
  background-color: aliceblue;
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```


## SISRS
### Step 1
Creates specified output file and file organization within it. Produces the ```TaxonList.txt``` from names of folders in data folder. 

slurm submission file: ```1_submit.slurm``` 

```{bash, comment=NA, echo=FALSE, class.output="bg_slurm"}

cat 1_submit.slurm


```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
